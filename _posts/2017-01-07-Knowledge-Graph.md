### Future focus

1. Better search methds
2. Semantics intergration
3. Reasoning 

### Ontology

Ontology is the [philosophical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy) study of the nature of [being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being), [becoming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becoming_(philosophy)), [existence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence) or [reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality) as well as the basic [categories of being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_of_being) and their relations.

#### Ontology in computer science

- Conceptualization
- Explict
- Formal
- Share

#### Ontology Formalization

$$
O = \{C,R.F,A,I\}
$$

- Concepts
- Relations
- Functions
- Axioms
- Instances

### Knowledge Graph

The **Knowledge Graph** is a [knowledge base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base) used by [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) to enhance its [search engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine)'s search results with [semantic-search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_search) information gathered from a wide variety of sources. 

knowledge graph is the structured representation of processed data.

#### what can it do 

1. Annotated entities and relations-semantic intergration
2. Indexing and retrieving entities and relations not just string-search from string to entities and relation
3. Quenstion-answering
4. Inferring new facts:learning rules from KG
5. Data analysis based on KG
6. Add meaning to the web observatory
7. Give analysis and interpretation about real world


#### Limitations of existing knowledge graph

1. Imbalance of knowladge in difference language
2. low integration of multilingual knowledge
3. lack of research on the knowledge complement of different language

[RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework)

The **Resource Description Framework** (**RDF**) is a family of [World Wide Web Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium) (W3C) [specifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification)[1] originally designed as a [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) [data model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model). It has come to be used as a general method for conceptual description or modeling of information that is implemented in [web resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_resource), using a variety of syntax notations and [data serialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_serialization) formats. It is also used in [knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management) applications.
